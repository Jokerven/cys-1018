      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This website was created by putting considerable thoughts into the following steps: UI Design, Implementation,
        mobile responsiveness, and review.
      </p>

      <h1>UI Design</h1>
      <p>
        UI design, the process through which designers create user interfaces in software or digital devices with an
        emphasis on aesthetics or style. These designs provide a visual representation of user-friendly graphical
        interfaces. The UI design for this website was built on
        <a href="https://whimsical.com" class="link">Whimsical</a> after doing extensive research on different website
        thereby drawing design inspiration from a few websites, most of which came from
        <a href="https://www.adeolaadeoti.xyz" class="link">adeolaadeoti.xyz</a>
      </p>

      <div class="design">
        <img src="/images/design-home.png" alt="design home" />

        <img src="/images/design-portfolio.png" alt="design portfolio" />

        <img src="/images/design-contact.png" alt="design contact" />

        <img src="/images/design-blog.png" alt="design blog" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p>
          The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are two of the most important and
          fundamental web technologies. HTML is a set of markup codes that are placed into a file for internet display.
          The markup instructs the web browser on how to display the words and graphics on a web page. Using components,
          tags, and attributes, we are able to construct structural sections, paragraphs, and links. It's worth
          mentioning, though, that HTML isn't a programming language because it can't be used to create dynamic
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS, on the other hand, is a basic design language that is used to control the appearance and feel of a
          webpage. You may modify the color of the text, the font style, the space between paragraphs and other style
          based modifications using CSS.
        </p>

        <div class="design">
          <img src="/images/home.png" alt="home" />

          <img src="/images/portfolio.png" alt="portfolio" />

          <img src="/images/contact.png" alt="contact" />

          <img src="/images/blog.png" alt="blog" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Mobile Responsiveness</h1>
        <p>A responsive web design is one that will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.</p>
        <p>In this website, I added mobile responsiveness using css mobile query.</p>

        <div class="design">
          <img src="/images/mobile-home.png" alt="home" />

          <img src="/images/mobile-portfolio.png" alt="portfolio" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Validation</h1>
        <div class="design">
          <img src="/images/index-validate.png" alt="index validate" />

          <img src="/images/index-css-validate.png" alt="index css validate" />

          <img src="/images/portfolio-validate.png" alt="portfolio validate" />

          <img src="/images/portfolio-css-validate.png" alt="portfolio css validate" />

          <img src="/images/contact-validate.png" alt="contact validate" />

          <img src="/images/contact-css-validate.png" alt="contact css validate" />

          <img src="/images/blog-validate.png" alt="blog validate" />

          <img src="/images/blog-css-validate.png" alt="blog css validate" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Drawbacks and Reflection</h1>

        <p>
          I did have some concerns about how to approach mobile responsiveness, starting with the mobile navigation
          without the usage of javascript to turn on and off the navigation menu. This was a little difficult, but after
          some research, I discovered that there was a method to achieve it using an html input checkbox for the toggle
          action and CSS to design the label that is bound to the checkbox as a hamburger menu on which the toggle is
          done. I found out that to achieve mobile responsiveness, I had to use "mobile first" design approach which
          simply entails that you have to create the web pages for mobile screens first before moving up to larger
          screen sizes
        </p>

        <p>
          The project appeared challenging at first, but it was ultimately gratifying since it introduced me to the
          principles of the web and web technology in general. I had to learn how to use git commands and github for
          version control. I designed and constructed a website that was responsive, functional, user-friendly, and most
          importantly, useable. Over the course of this project, I've gained a wider understanding of web development,
          web technologies, and the fundamentals of software engineering.
